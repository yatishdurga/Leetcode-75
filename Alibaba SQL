# Compressed Mean - Alibaba SQL Interview Question

## Question

You're tasked with calculating the mean number of items per order on Alibaba, rounded to 1 decimal place. The problem involves two columns:

- **`item_count`**: The number of items in each order.
- **`order_occurrences`**: The count of orders for each respective `item_count`.

### Example Input:

| item_count | order_occurrences |
|------------|-------------------|
| 1          | 500               |
| 2          | 1000              |
| 3          | 800               |
| 4          | 1000              |

### Example Output:

| mean |
|------|
| 2.7  |

### Explanation:

The mean is calculated as follows:

1. **Total Items**: Multiply `item_count` by `order_occurrences` for each row and sum the results:  
   `(1 * 500) + (2 * 1000) + (3 * 800) + (4 * 1000) = 8900`

2. **Total Orders**: Sum the `order_occurrences`:  
   `500 + 1000 + 800 + 1000 = 3300`

3. **Mean**: Divide total items by total orders and round to 1 decimal place:  
   `Mean = 8900 / 3300 = 2.7`

## Solution

Hereâ€™s the correct SQL query to calculate the mean:

```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(
    SUM(item_count::DECIMAL * order_occurrences)
    / SUM(order_occurrences),
  1) AS mean
FROM items_per_order;
